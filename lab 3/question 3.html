            <h2>ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)</h2>
            <P>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks usually requiring human intelligence. These tasks include recognizing speech, making decisions, learning from data, and even understanding natural language. Over recent years, AI has made significant advancements, transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and entertainment.<br>
One key reason for AIâ€™s rapid progress is the availability of vast amounts of data and increased computing power. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. This has led to innovations such as voice assistants, personalized recommendations, and self-driving cars.<br>

Despite its benefits, AI also raises important ethical questions, including concerns about privacy, job displacement, and decision-making transparency. As AI continues to evolve, balancing technological progress with responsible use will be crucial for shaping a future that benefits everyone.</P>

    <h3>MACHINE LEARING (ML)</h3>
    <P>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML systems analyze patterns in data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.<BR>

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data; unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where an agent learns by interacting with its environment to maximize rewards.<BR>

Machine learning powers many everyday technologies, such as spam filters, recommendation engines, facial recognition, and fraud detection. As data becomes more abundant and computing power increases, machine learning continues to drive innovation across industries.<BR>

However, it also presents challenges such as data bias, privacy concerns, and the need for transparency in automated decisions. Responsible development and use of machine learning are essential for maximizing its benefits while minimizing potential harms.<BR>
